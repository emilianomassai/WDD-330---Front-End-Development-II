    <h1>Notes of Week 2</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 2: Programming Basics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Primitive Data Types</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them are primitive
          data types and are listed below: 
          <ol>
            <li>
                String
            </li>
            <li>
                Symbol
                        </li>
            <li>
                Number
            </li>
            <li>
                Boolean
            </li>
            <li>
                Undefined
            </li>
            <li>
                Null
            </li>
        
          </ol>
            <br />
          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Not Primitive Data Types</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Objects
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrays
            </li>
            <li>
                Functions
            </li>
        
          </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
   <p>
    Scope is an important concept in programming. It refers to where a constant or variable is accessible by the program. There are two common scopes that are often referred to in programs: global scope and local scope.
   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
    <h3>Global Scope</h3>
<p>
    Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have global scope. This means it is accessible everywhere in the program. While this may seem to be a good idea at first, it is not considered good practice.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
    <h3>Local Scope</h3>
<p>
    Any variables defined inside a block using the let or const will only be available inside that block and not be accessible outside of that block.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>The join() Method</h3>

        <p>
            The join() method can be used to turn the array into a string that comprises all the items in the array, separated by commas
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Slicing and Splicing</h3>
  
          <p>
            The slice() method creates a subarray; effectively chopping out a slice of an original array, starting at one position and finishing at another.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Reverse</h3>
  
          <p>
            We can reverse the order of an array using the reverse() method. This changes the order of the array permanently.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Chapter 4: Functions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3> Keep Your Code DRY</h3>
  
          <p>
            Don’t Repeat Yourself, or DRY, is a principle of programming that specifies that every part of a program should only be written once. This avoids duplication and means there’s no need to keep multiple pieces of code up to date and in sync.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3> Arrow Functions</h3>
  
          <p>
            Arrow functions can be identified by the 'arrow' symbol, => that gives them their name. The parameters come before the arrow and the main body of the function comes after. Arrow functions are always anonymous, so if you want to refer to them, you must assign them to a variable.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3> Function Hoisting</h3>
  
          <p>
            Hoisting is the JavaScript interpreter’s action of moving all variable and function declarations to the top of the current scope, regardless of where they are defined.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
