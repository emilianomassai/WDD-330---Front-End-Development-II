            I found an error in the Story Editor code. When It shows the
            JavaScript snippet, the example uses double quotes inside
            document.getElementById. I needed to change them to single quotes to
            make the script working.
          </li>

            I'm trying to use Ajax to create header and footer snippet to use
            for each page of the website. It seems to work but not sure if this
            is the best practice. I used it to create code snippets with PHP in
            a similar way.
