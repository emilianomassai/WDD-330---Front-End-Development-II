            I found an error in the Story Editor code. When It shows the
            JavaScript snippet, the example uses double quotes inside
            <span id="code">document.getElementById.</span> I needed to change
            them to single quotes to make the script working.

            I'm trying to use Ajax to create header and footer snippet to use
            for each page of the website. It seems to work but not sure if this
            is the best practice. I used it to create code snippets with PHP in
            a similar way.

            How efficient or secure is using local storage? Is there any way to
            wipe out from the computer the data stored once saved? What is the
            max size allowed to store in this way?
