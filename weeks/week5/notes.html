    <h1>Notes of Week 5</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
        <p>
          Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are
          usually caused by one of the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>System error</b> ― there’s a problem with the system or external
            devices with which the program is interacting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Programmer error</b> ― the program contains incorrect syntax or
            faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>User error</b> ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the
            program is unable to handle.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Exceptions</h3>
        <p>
          An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be
          used by the program to deal with the error. For example, trying to
          call a method that is nonexistent will result in a reference error
          that raises an exception, as you can see in the example below when we
          try to call the mythical <code>unicorn()</code> function:
        </p>
        <code>unicorn(); &lt;&lt; ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Stack Traces</h3>
        <p>
          An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of
          functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error
          occurred. It’s often not just a single function or method call that
          causes an error. A stack trace will work backwards from the point at
          which the error occurred to identify the original function or method
          that started the sequence. The example below shows how a stack trace
          can help you find where an error originates from:
        </p>
        <pre><code>function three(){ unicorn(); }
            function two(){ three(); }
            function one(){ two(); }
            one();
            
            &lt;&lt; index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined
                at three (index.html:13)
                at two (index.html:17)
                at one (index.html:21)
                at index.html:24`
                        </code></pre>

        <p>
          In this example, we have three functions: function one() invokes
          function two(), which then invokes function three().
          Function three() then invokes the unicorn() function that doesn't
          exist and causes an error. We can use the stack trace to work
          backwards and see that this error was caused by invoking the
          function one() in the first place.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Warnings</h3>
        <p>
          A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough
          to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to
          run after a warning. This might sound good, but it can be problematic,
          since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to
          continue running incorrectly. An example of a mistake that could cause
          a warning is assigning a value to a variable that’s undeclared:
        </p>

        <pre><code>pi = 3.142; 
            &lt;&lt; JavaScript Warning: assignment to undeclared variable
          </code></pre>
        <p>
          Note that not all browsers will display a warning for the code in the
          example above, so you might not see one if you try it out. Warnings
          and exceptions are presented differently in various environments. Some
          browsers will show a small icon in the corner of the browser window to
          indicate that an exception or warning has occurred. Others require the
          console to be open to see any warnings or exceptions. When a runtime
          error occurs in the browser, the HTML will still appear, but the
          JavaScript code will stop working in the background, which isn’t
          always obvious at first. If a warning occurs, the JavaScript will
          continue to run (although possibly incorrectly).
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>The Importance of Testing and Debugging</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a fairly forgiving language when it comes to errors; it
          didn’t implement exceptions at all until ECMAScript version 3. Instead
          of alerting a user to an error in a program, it just failed silently
          in the background, and this is sometimes still the case. It might seem
          like a good idea at first, but the error might give unexpected or
          incorrect results that nobody spots, or lurk in the background for a
          long time before causing the program to crash spectacularly. Failing
          silently makes errors difficult to spot and longer to track down. For
          this reason, a ninja programmer should ensure that the code they write
          fails loudly in development so any errors can be identified and fixed
          quickly. In production, a ninja programmer should try to make the code
          fail gracefully (although not completely silently ― we still need to
          know there’s an error), so the user experience is not affected, if
          possible. This is achieved by making sure exceptions are caught and
          dealt with, and code is tested rigorously.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
        <p>
          ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions
          and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. This
          is due to the fact that strict mode considers coding practices that
          were previously accepted as just being 'poor style' as actual errors.
          Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the
          first line of a JavaScript file:
        </p>
        <code>'use strict';</code>
        <p>
          You can even use strict mode on a per-function basis by adding the
          line inside a function. Strict mode will then only be applied to
          anything inside that function.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
        <p>
          Browser vendors are constantly adding support for these new features,
          but they don’t always keep up.  The recommended way to determine
          browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. This is
          done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists
          before trying to actually call the method.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Debugging in the Browser</h3>
        <p>
          There are a number of options for debugging JavaScript code in the
          browser.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>The Trusty Alert</h4>
            <p>
              The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to
              show a dialog at certain points in the code. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Using the Console</h4>
            <p>
              Most modern JavaScript environments have a console object that
              provides a number of methods for logging information and
              debugging. It's not officially part of the ECMAScript
              specification, but is well supported in all the major browsers and
              Node.js. The <code>console.trace()</code> method will log an
              interactive stack trace in the console. This will show the
              functions that were called in the lead up to an exception
              occurring while the code is running.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
