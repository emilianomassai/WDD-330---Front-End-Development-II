    <h2>MDN: Validating forms</h2>

    <p>
      Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of
      good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the
      user can fix it straight away.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>What is form validation?</h3>
        <p>
          When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to
          see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints
          set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called
          client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called
          server-side validation.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Different types of client-side validation</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Built-in form validation uses HTML form validation features, which
            we've discussed in many places throughout this module. This
            validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form
            validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as
            customizable as JavaScript validation.
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is
            completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a
            library).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Using built-in form validation</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in
            before the form can be submitted.
          </li>
          <li>
            minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of
            textual data (strings).
          </li>
          <li>
            min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical
            input types.
          </li>
          <li>
            type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email
            address, or some other specific preset type.
          </li>
          <li>
            pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the
            entered data needs to follow.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Validating forms using JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          You must use JavaScript if you want to take control over the look and
          feel of native error messages.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>The Constraint Validation API</h3>
        <p>
          Most browsers support the Constraint Validation API, which consists of
          a set of methods and properties available on the following form
          element DOM interfaces:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>HTMLButtonElement (represents a button element)</li>
          <li>HTMLFieldSetElement (represents a fieldset element)</li>
          <li>HTMLInputElement (represents an input element)</li>
          <li>HTMLOutputElement (represents an output element)</li>
          <li>HTMLSelectElement (represents a select element)</li>
          <li>HTMLTextAreaElement (represents a textarea element)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Validating forms without a built-in API</h3>
        <p>
          In some cases, such as custom controls, you won't be able to or won't
          want to use the Constraint Validation API. You're still able to use
          JavaScript to validate your form, but you'll just have to write your
          own.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using the Fetch API</h2>
    <p>
      The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and
      manipulating parts of the protocol, such as requests and responses. It
      also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way
      to fetch resources asynchronously across the network. The fetch
      specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in the following significant
      ways:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The Promise returned from fetch() won't reject on HTTP error status even
        if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, as soon as the server
        responds with headers, the Promise will resolve normally (with the ok
        property of the response set to false if the response isn't in the range
        200–299), and it will only reject on network failure or if anything
        prevented the request from completing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unless fetch() is called with the credentials option set to include,
        fetch():
        <ul>
          <li>won't send cookies in cross-origin requests</li>
          <li>won't set any cookies sent back in cross-origin responses</li>
          <li>
            As of August 2018, the default credentials policy changed to
            same-origin. Firefox was also modified in version 61.0b13)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Supplying request options</h3>
        <p>
          The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init
          object that allows you to control a number of different settings.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Sending a request with credentials included</h3>
        <p>
          To cause browsers to send a request with credentials included on both
          same-origin and cross-origin calls, add credentials: 'include' to the
          init object you pass to the fetch() method.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Uploading JSON data</h3>
        <p>Use fetch() to POST JSON-encoded data.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Uploading a file</h3>
        <p>
          Files can be uploaded using an HTML input type="file" input element,
          FormData() and fetch().
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Processing a text file line by line</h3>
        <p>
          The chunks that are read from a response are not broken neatly at line
          boundaries and are Uint8Arrays, not strings. If you want to fetch a
          text file and process it line by line, it is up to you to handle these
          complications.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Checking that the fetch was successful</h3>
        <p>
          A fetch() promise will reject with a TypeError when a network error is
          encountered or CORS is misconfigured on the server-side, although this
          usually means permission issues or similar — a 404 does not constitute
          a network error, for example. An accurate check for a successful
          fetch() would include checking that the promise resolved, then
          checking that the Response.ok property has a value of true.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Response objects</h3>

        <p>
          As you have seen above, Response instances are returned when fetch()
          promises are resolved. The most common response properties you'll use
          are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Response.status — An integer (default value 200) containing the
            response status code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Response.statusText — A string (default value ""), which corresponds
            to the HTTP status code message. Note that HTTP/2 does not support
            status messages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Response.ok — seen in use above, this is a shorthand for checking
            that status is in the range 200-299 inclusive. This returns a
            boolean value.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
