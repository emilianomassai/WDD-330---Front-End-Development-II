    <h2>Array.prototype.filter()</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The filter() method is an immutable JavaScript array iteration method
          that creates a new array filled with all the original array elements
          that pass the test provided by the callback function without changing
          the original array.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          OriginalArray.filter() iterates in in the array to check for matches.
          inventor: is the object currently being executed. If the actual object
          matches the requirements, it will be stored in the new array.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Array.prototype.map()</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The map() is a built-in array method for iterating through the
          elements inside an array collection in JavaScript. Think of looping as
          a way to progress from one element to another in a list, while still
          maintaining the order and position of each element.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          OriginalArray.map() iterates through the objects in the original array
          and store the chosen properties of each object (in this case first and
          last name) to the new array.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Array.prototype.sort()</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns
          the reference to the same array, now sorted. The default sort order is
          ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then
          comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          OriginalArray.sort() Between all the different main sorting types
          (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick and Heap), the one mainly
          used in this built-in array method is the merge sort.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Array.prototype.reduce()</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The reduce() method executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback
          function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return
          value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result
          of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single
          value.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          OriginalArray.reduce() accumulator starts from 0 and adds each time
          the selected value to the sum. In this case, for each object
          (inventor) in the array, it takes the years lived from each inventor
          and adds them up to get to a single value.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
