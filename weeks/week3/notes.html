    <h1>Notes of Week 3</h1>

     <h2>Chapter 5: Objects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Object methods, "this"</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.
            </li>
            <li>
              Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().
            </li>
            <li>
              Methods can reference the object as this.
            </li>
            <li>
              The value of this is defined at run-time.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called.
            </li>
            <li>
              A function can be copied between objects.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object.
            </li>            
            <li>
              Arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.
            </li>
          </ul>
            <br />
          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Object Literals </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
              An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions. 
            </li>
            <li>
              One way to think about an object is that it’s like a dictionary where you look up a property name and see a value. 
            </li>
            <li>
              All objects are mutable at any time when a program is running. This means that its properties and methods can be changed or removed, and new properties and methods can be added to the object, even if it was declared using const. 

            </li>
        
          </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
        <h3>Finding all the Properties of an Object 
        </h3>
   <p>
    We can loop through all of an object’s properties and methods by using a for in loop. 
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Objects Are Copied By Reference </h4>
        <p>This means that if a variable is assigned to an object that already exists, it will simply point to the exact same space in memory. So any changes made using either reference will affect the same object. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Objects as Parameters to Functions </h4>
        <p>This is useful when there are a large number of parameters, as it allows the arguments to be provided by name and in any order. 
        </p>
    </li>
    </ul>

    
   </p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
  <h3>Namespacing</h3>
<p>
  Naming collisions occur when the same variable or function name is used for different purposes by code sharing the same scope. 
  A solution to this problem is to use the object literal pattern to create a namespace for groups of related functions. This is done by creating an object literal that serves as the namespace, then adding any values as properties of that object, and any functions as methods. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
  <h3>JSON</h3>
<p>
  JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, was invented by Douglas Crockford in 2001. JSON is a string representation of the object literal notation. 
  The parse() method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a JavaScript object.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
  <h3>The RegExp Object   </h3>
<p>
  A regular expression (or RegExp, for short) is a pattern that can be used to search strings for matches to the pattern. A common use is 'find and replace' type operations. 

</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="questions">Chapter 5 Questions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    I'm working with databases at work and I see some similarities between objects manipulation and how you retrieve data from databases. For example, 
    if you want to find values from multiple tables, you JOIN two table and then you access them like this: <br>
<pre><code>
    SELECT u.firstName, u.lastName, a.address * FROM tblUsers u
    JOIN tblAddress a ON u.userId = a.userId
    WHERE firstName = 'Emiliano' AND lastName = 'Massai'
</code></pre>
    Is u.firstName like object.property?
  </li>
</ol>

      <h2>Chapter 6: The Document Object Model </h2>
      <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled. 
        The DOM treats everything on a web page as a node. The HTML tag is the root node, and every other part of the document is a child node of this. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Query Selectors </h3>
  
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The <b>document.querySelector()</b>  method allows you to use CSS notation to find the first element in the document that matches that matches a CSS selector provided as an argument. If no elements match, it will return null.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The <b>document.querySelectorAll()</b> method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list of all the elements in the document that match the CSS query selector. If no elements match, it will return an empty node list. 
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            <b>jQuery</b> is a popular JavaScript framework that makes it very easy to find elements on a page using a CSS-style syntax. 

            </p>
        </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Updating CSS  </h3>
  
              <p>Every element node has a style property. This can be used to dynamically modify the presentation of any element on a web page. 
              </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="questions">Chapter 6 Questions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Are we going to use a lot of jQuery this semester? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using it on the code?
  </li>
</ol>


      <h2>Chapter 7: Events </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Event Listeners </h3>
  
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>They are like setting a notification to alert you when something happens. The follow script will display “Hello World” to the console each time the user will click into the body of the document: <br>
<pre><code>
      &lt;script&gt;
      document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);
      function doSomething() {
        console.log("Hello World!");
      }
      &lt;script&gt;
</code></pre>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Event Propagation</h3>
                  <p>Event propagation is the order that the events fire on each element. There are two forms of event propagation: bubbling and capturing. 
                  </p>
               
                <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><b>Bubbling</b> is when the event fires on the element clicked on first, then bubbles up the document tree, firing an event on each parent element until it reaches the root node. 
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><b>Capturing</b> starts by firing an event on the root element, then propagates downwards, firing an event on each child element until it reaches the target element that was clicked on. 
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="questions">Chapter 7 Questions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    The addEventListener is very useful tool but I don't see the point of use it to fire each time an user clicks into the body of the document. Is that used from trackers or data collection? 
  </li>
  <li>
    What is the best approach when talking about event propagation? Is more efficient using bubbling or capturing?
  </li>
</ol>
